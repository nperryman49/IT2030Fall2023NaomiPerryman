The type of retail web application for this project will be clothing under the name Naomi's Retro Closet. 

This idea comes from experience trying to find clothing from previous decades and encountering only decade-inspired expensive clothing online, unorganized clothing in second-hand shops, or cheap costumes online and in stores. In this application, sellers will be able to list clothing they have from the 90's and prior. There will be no age limit for clothes, although it is probable that most clothing will be from the later decades of the 20th century. 

It will have a similar concept to Etsy in that individual sellers and buyers can use the app at their own discretion to sell and price individual items as well as rate sellers. The application will be organized in several ways. One filter would be by decade, another by apparel category such as pants or accessories, by size, by color, and by price. A 5% transaction fee will be applied to each sale that the company will take which is lower than Etsy's 6.5% cut. Customers looking for vintage apparel will be easily able to find second-hand, authentic apparel online that is presented in an organized fashion.
