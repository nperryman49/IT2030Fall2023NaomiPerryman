In your GitHub Week 16 lab Readme.md file, list three things you learned in ASP.NET Core MVC web programming course. Be specific and include a brief description with details.
1. I learned how an MVC web app worked which was different from other courses where they focused on other types of applications or on only web design/interactive web design. In an MVC app however, the model
   functions as the database of a web app while the controller goes between the model and the view, which is what the user sees. The view is displayed to the user and it will depend on what data is
   requested from the model.
2. I also learned how to use Bootstrap classs which is something I wanted to do before the course began. Some examples of these include Bootstrap classes for colors, information cards for events that include
   relevant images, and collapsable menus for an FAQ page which I have seen on a number of sites that have longer FAQ pages.
3. Creating databases was also something I learned that I found useful since web applications that sell products would have to have a database. Being able to add and delete products as inventory changes is
   a necessity. For this course, I created a database that can be added to for both the Contact and Product items. 

List three features that can be added to your application to improve the application for users. Be specific and include a brief description with details. List your three features in your GitHub Week 16 Readme.md file.
1. A search feature would be useful for any customer who is looking for a specific item, especially as the product list grows and looking through large amounts of items would be cumbersome. A search results
   filter would be ideal for this.
2. A category feature on the side can also help those customers who are not looking for a specific item but want to look through a category of items such as only shoes or only sweaters. Being able to filter the
   products page with those products whose category matches the one selected by the user would be another feature I would want to implement.
3. When a product is about to go out of stock, a certain number can trigger a display on a particular product that has less than a certain amount left in stock. This number can be updated and displayed until
   the item is no longer in stock. 

Code one of the features listed in (2) above and provide information of what you coded in your blackboard submission. 
Note: The information provided in your blackboard submission should give a summary of what was coded in your project as well as the file(s) that has the code feature applied to it.


Make a copy of your Week 14 lab files and using the copy, make 4 style updates to your application. Specify the filename(s) that has the 4 updates and specify the 4 style updates as well in your Readme.md file. 
Include entire filename path when specifying filename(s).
1. To better display the items on the homepage navbar, I made the link list items white in color and contain a bold font-weight.
