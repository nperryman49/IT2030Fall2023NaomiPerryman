Summary
This week I worked with creating databases for products and conctacts using EF Core. In both the ContactModel and ProductModel class, I added an ID field with the key attribute. 
For the ContactModel, validation and custom error messages were added to the Address and Message fields. 
A new folder was created for data. The ProductModel and ContactModel are both used as entity types. 
Links were added for both the ContactDb and ProductDb. CRUD pages were created using the Entity Frameowrk for the ProductModel and ContactModel. 
EF Core migrations were used to create the database using the package manager console with the commands "Add-Migration Initial" and "Update-Database."
Four contacts were added to the ContactDb table and the existing 6 products were added to the ProductDb.
